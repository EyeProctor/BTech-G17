Components Structure: (In Bracket Args received by Components)

- App.js
    - QuizHeader.js   : (userData, quizSubject)
    - QuizBody.js     : (QuizData)
        - QuestionBody.js : (it will take QuizData and maintain a state containing current userChoices)
            - Question
            - options
            - next
            - prev 
        - RightPanel.js : (userChoices state received from QuestionBody)
            - A panel of all Question list with appropriate color coding
            - OnClick fuction on QuestionIcon should have a function that will update Question on QuestionBody
        
    
UserChoice {
    userPrn: Number,
    attempted: [Number Array],
    flagged: [Number Array],
    startTime: DateTime (dd-mm-yyy hh:mm)
    endTime: Calculate from startTime (StartTime + duration )
}

also while defining Timer look for logic of auto saving userChoice State and then closing Window

The RightPanel Component still doesn't have an OnClick on cards it depends how we are going to manage state we have 2 days to complete atleast some UI to show
